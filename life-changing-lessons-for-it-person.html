                <p>This is the list of top X articles/books/talks which influenced me professionally the most.</p>
<h2>It's all subjective</h2>
<p>Everything below works for me. It would not necessarily work for you.
Because...</p>
<h2>Context matters</h2>
<p>Context matters much more than anything else. What works with particular people and the specific problem would not work with other people or other problems.</p>
<p>Experience is not knowing what's the most effective way of working. Experience is our capability to quickly adapt to a new context and find the most effective way of working in this new context.</p>
<h2>Designing solutions</h2>
<h3><a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">"Simple Made Easy"</a> by Rich Hickey</h3>
<p>"Easy" and "Hard" is a description of the effort required to get to the solution. "Simple" and "Complex" are the properties of a solution. It could be easy to get to a complex solution and quite difficult to get to a simple one.</p>
<p>Once I understood it, my reasoning about the selection of the best solution became way more objective.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications">"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"</a> by Martin Kleppmann</h3>
<p>The book is a must-read for everybody building distributed applications. A lot of takeaways, to name a few: consistency levels - how to achieve, which one to use then; databases - internals, use cases; various consensus algorithms, 2-phase commits, 3-phase commits, sagas. All these explained in one single book.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85012.Enterprise_Integration_Patterns">"Enterprise Integration Patterns"</a> by Gregor Hohpe</h3>
<p>It's about integration patterns between (micro)services. It's quite objective. Almost all you need to know in one book.</p>
<h2>Being functional and reactive</h2>
<p>Being functional and controlling side effects has its value. Not going to convince, stuff below for already convinced.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf/">"Category Theory for Programmers"</a> by Bartosz Milewski</h3>
<p>Bartosz Milewski explains Category Theory and gives examples of its applicability for software engineering. Essential if you want to understand why our beloved Cats, ZIO, and their friends are like that. Why is monad defined as it is and why are its laws defined as they and not differently?</p>
<p>And OMG, it's hard. I get back to it from time to time to refresh basic math and find out if the material is more clear now? I still have no idea what's going on in advanced topics there.</p>
<h3><a href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a></h3>
<p>That's a small "just for frontend" language that transpiles into JavaScript. Elm is almost pure lambda calculus. Think of it as of really-really simplified Haskell. Playing with it should turn one's brain in a right Functional position.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall98/cs441/mainus/node12.html">Subtyping VS Subclassing VS Inheritance</a></h3>
<p>Ok, this is a short one. Do you realize inheritance, subtyping, and subclassing are all three different terms with their meaning and not just synonyms? I didn't until I read the article.</p>
<p>And after reading that, I was like, "So that's why my OOP design was so screwed!"</p>
<h2>Talking to business people</h2>
<h3>Domain Driven Design</h3>
<p>Of course, there is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design">the book by Eric Evans</a>, but I'm not sure what exactly to recommend. My understanding of DDD was through various workshops, chats with friends, and other unstructured sources.</p>
<p>Main takeaways of DDD:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on problem definition before you even start thinking about the solution. Literally - do not think about the solution until all the stakeholders agree with the problem definition.</li>
<li>There are people with questions. There are people with answers. There are people in between. People in between can either be a bottleneck in knowledge transfer or facilitate it. Build processes to make people in between facilitators.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry, no bounded context, aggregates, and other stuff DDD is famous for. I told you it would be subjective.</p>
<h3>That book I forgot</h3>
<p>So, it was like the early 2000s. I do not remember what the book  was about, but I recall a single takeaway - rules of delegation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the problem.</li>
<li>Discuss possible solutions.</li>
<li>Notify about a deadline if it is.</li>
<li>Notify about the consequences of failure and the definition of failure.</li>
<li>Notify about the consequences of success and the definition of success.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds obvious, right? Yet, I almost do not see people providing or asking for all this information. If you give a task or somebody gives you a task - make sure all five points are there.</p>
<h2>Working with humans</h2>
<p>Software engineering is a young discipline. Many practices are based on the previous subjective experience of successful engineers. That means part of software engineer work is a negotiation with business people and other engineers. "Negotiation" is an engineering skill, and the more "senior" your position is, the more valuable this skill is.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22512931-building-microservices">"Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems"</a> by Sam Newman</h3>
<p>The most valuable part of the book is the second chapter - "The Evolutionary Architect." And it has nothing to do with Microservices. That's why the book is in the "Working with humans" section.</p>
<p>The main takeaway - in modern software development, an architect is not a decision-maker - they are a person to make sure all required decisions are made and followed.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21873100-the-ideal-executive?ac=1&amp;from_search=true&amp;qid=hQsaS9pmAG&amp;rank=1">"The Ideal Executive: Why You Cannot Be One and What to Do About It"</a> by Ichak Kalderon Adizes</h3>
<p>The book explains why there are no ideal managers. Engineers should know it to understand their managers, and managers should know it not to be stellar guys.</p>
<p>The main takeaway - do not avoid conflicts. We are different. We analyze problems from different perspectives. We have different goals and values, all that means two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>There would be a lot of conflicts before we get to the solution.</li>
<li>If these conflicts are resolved and not ignored, we will get a much more elegant solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not avoid conflicts - their resolution yields amazing results. Instead, teach yourself and people around you to separate emotions from conflict resolution. Conflicts are emotionally hard only if we make them emotionally hard. They are neutral.</p>
<h3>Applied Systems Analysis</h3>
<p>I studied Applied Systems Analysis in my childhood in Russia, so everything I read was in Russian, and anyway, I forgot all these books. Find on your own. I am almost sure, Mr <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_L._Ackoff">Russell Ackoff</a> wrote some excellent stuff.</p>
<p>My main takeaways are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Concept of "positive intervention" - with any intervention in a problematic situation, one should try to make at least one stakeholder happier and other stakeholders not sad.</li>
<li>Understanding the fact that "voting," "polling," etc. have nothing to do with "democracy," "everybody is valuable," etc. If everybody is valuable, listen to everybody and take the opinion of everyone into the account. Literally.</li>
</ol>
<h3><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_the_transformative_power_of_classical_music">"The transformative power of classical music"</a> by Benjamin Zander</h3>
<p>If you are short on time and ask me for the most important single item - watch that one.</p>
