KPI are not to set goals for people, but to measure health of the team.

OKR - something which gives team a purpose. No product related OKR. There is roadmap for product.
Purpose of OKR - increase productivity of the team or required horizon, in most cases with 
setting priority levels for solutions. There are should be no conflicts, so each OKR should have a priority.
They must be measureble.

Roadmap - Just roadmap. What should be done then.
