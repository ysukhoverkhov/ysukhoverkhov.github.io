## Table for events

Debezium is low level - it streams changes in table, it's up to us to set up proper table structure for even storage if our storage is event-sourced.

```MySQL
CREATE TABLE available_car
(
    aggregate_id bigint NOT NULL,
    seq_nr bigint NOT NULL,
    tags varchar(255),
    payload BLOB,
    PRIMARY KEY (aggregate_id, seq_nr)
);
```

* `aggregate_id` - is ID of entry we store events for
* `seq_nr` - sequence number of event in the journal
* `tags` - whatever you need to find events later
* `payload` - content of an event.

You may add timestamp - it could be handy, or other information you need.

`DELETE` and `UPDATE` statements on the table should not be allowed. Once your event persisted and published - it can't be modified. All hotfixes should be done via other events for corrections.
